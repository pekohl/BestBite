How

Here's the link to an HTML and CSS skeleton for the gallery. There are five main changes to be made:

-In the header section, add a row with two columns. In the first column, write the heading "BestBite." In the second column, make a navigation bar using Boostrap's pills. Add three links that say "About", "Sign Up", and "Log In." Set the class of the "About" item to be active.

-Add a background image to the jumbotron. The one we used is here. Then add a heading that says "Browse. Create. Share.", and use margins and Bootstrap's offset columns to achieve the alignment shown in the design.

-In the banner section, add a link that says "Learn More". Style the link into a large default Bootstrap button. Then use CSS to color it rgba(216,25,47,.5) and to adjust the top margin.

-In the supporting section, underneath the page-header div, add a row with three equal-sized columns. In each column, add a subheading, and then add a list containing recipe names. Feel free to use your own text.

-In the footer section, add text for each column, style the text as shown in the design, and color the background #eeeeee.
